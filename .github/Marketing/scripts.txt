Reel script: 

Script 1: Coffee scene
Streamlined Voiceover Script (Ideal for 45–60 sec Short)

Last week, I’m late to a coffee meeting—juggling keys, phone, and coffee. Total chaos.

I’m trying to text my friend, scrolling through a sea of contacts I haven’t touched in years.
Finally find her. Start typing.
And I think:
“There’s gotta be a better way.”

👉 Meet SmartChat.

Now I just say:
“Send Lisa I’m running five minutes late.”
The AI gets it. Finds Lisa. Writes the message. One tap. Done.

Three seconds instead of three minutes.

No commands. No learning curve. Just talk like a normal human:
“Tell Marcus I’ll call him later.”
“Message the team the meeting’s at 4.”

And yeah—it doesn’t read your chats. Just the command.
Your privacy stays private.

I’ve used it for two weeks.
It’s free. It’s fast.
And honestly? Messaging finally makes sense.

✅ Try SmartChat. Your future self will thank you.
